[Corover](https://corover.ai/) | Machine Learning and AI Developer Intern
=====
Industrial Intern | Banglore, Karnataka | _May '24 - Current_


### Key Responsibilities and Achievements

- **Developed a real-time face recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and the face-recognition library**: Integrated deep learning for face encoding, implemented secure registration, Aadhaar details retrieval for recognized faces, and managed data through CSV file storage and Tkinter GUI.  I also created a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit and WebRTC for real-time video streaming and face recognition, which can be used on Zoom or Google Meet calls for authentication purposes, specifically for interview-like environments.

- **Currently working under the CTO of Corover.ai**: I am also leading a team of 4 interns and training them in basic skills required to build an LLM and fine tune an LLM.
 
- **Developed a real-time text-to-speech system using Bark framework integrated with Torch and Coqui TTS**: Implemented voice synthesis from text, utilizing deep learning techniques for efficient audio generation. Successfully loaded and utilized pretrained checkpoints for model evaluation and synthesized high-quality speech outputs saved as WAV files.
