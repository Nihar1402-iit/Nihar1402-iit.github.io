[Corover](https://corover.ai/) | Machine Learning and AI Developer Intern
=====
Industrial Intern | Banglore, Karnataka | _May '24 - Current_


### Key Responsibilities and Achievements


- **Developed a Bigram Language Model using PyTorch** with a transformer architecture to generate text based on pathology data from Robbins-Pathologic2005.txt. Implemented multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers to capture complex patterns in text sequences. Achieved effective text generation capabilities and demonstrated proficiency in model training and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Developed a real-time face recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and the face-recognition library**: Integrated deep learning for face encoding, implemented secure registration, Aadhaar details retrieval for recognized faces, and managed data through CSV file storage and Tkinter GUI.  I also created a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit and WebRTC for real-time video streaming and face recognition, which can be used on Zoom or Google Meet calls for authentication purposes, specifically for interview-like environments.

- **Currently working under the CTO of Corover.ai**: I am also leading a team of 4 interns and training them in basic skills required to build an LLM and fine tune an LLM.
 
- **Developed a real-time text-to-speech system using Bark framework integrated with Torch and Coqui TTS**: Implemented voice synthesis from text, utilizing deep learning techniques for efficient audio generation. Successfully loaded and utilized pretrained checkpoints for model evaluation and synthesized high-quality speech outputs saved as WAV files.
  
- Developed a multimedia processing application using Python, integrating libraries such as MoviePy, SpeechRecognition, and Transformers. Implemented functionality to convert MP4 videos to WAV format, transcribe speech to text, summarize content, and perform sentiment analysis. The application also generates synthesized speech from summarized text and classifies the working environment based on sentiment analysis.
