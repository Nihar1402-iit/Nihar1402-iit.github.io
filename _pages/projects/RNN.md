## RNN_Self-Attention_Sine_Prediction
_Apr, 2024 - May, 2024_
(Advisor â€“ Prof. Prof. Nipun Batra, IIT Gandhinagar) | [Project Link](https://github.com/Nihar1402-iit/RNN_Self-Attention_Sine_Prediction)

- Created a simple RNN model and a custom self-attention model for predicting sine and cosine values.
- Analyzed prediction curves and calculated MSE loss to assess model performance.
- Achieved accurate classification results, visualized convolutional layer outputs to interpret learned features, and demonstrated effective model performance through classification matrices.Demonstrated expertise in time series forecasting and advanced deep learning techniques.
