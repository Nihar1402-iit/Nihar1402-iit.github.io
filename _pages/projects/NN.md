 [Project Link](https://github.com/Nihar1402-iit/House-Price-Prediction-with-PyTorch)

- This project utilizes PyTorch to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.

- It demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering), model building, training, and evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

- The project monitors model performance by tracking loss metrics and visualizes the loss curve across training epochs to help understand the model's learning progression.
