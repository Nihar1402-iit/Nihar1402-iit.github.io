- This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes health features like glucose level, BMI, and blood pressure.

- The project involves preprocessing the dataset, building a feedforward ANN, training the model on patient data, and evaluating its performance on classifying diabetes cases.

- The model's training progress is tracked through the loss function, and the loss curve is visualized to demonstrate the networkâ€™s learning over multiple epochs.
