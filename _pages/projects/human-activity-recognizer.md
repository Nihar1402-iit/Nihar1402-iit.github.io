## Human Activity Recognizer (using Machine Learning)
_Jan, 2024 - Feb, 2024_
(Advisor â€“ Prof. Prof. Nipun Batra, IIT Gandhinagar) | [Project Link](https://github.com/Nihar1402-iit/Human-Activity-Recognizer)

- Made a machine learning model that uses only decision trees to recognize 6 different human activities by utilizing time series data of acceleration involved.
- Learned to handle time series data by employing featurization and dimension reduction. Performed hyperparameter tuning select the best model based on bias-variance tradeoff. Deployed the model and tested the predictions on real acceleration data from collected from a smartphone.
