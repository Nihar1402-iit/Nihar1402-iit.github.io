[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

About Me:
-----
I am currently a sophomore at one of the most prestigious technological institutes, **Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar**, majoring in Electrical Engineering.

-	I am currently mastering my skills in  Machine Learning to solve real-life problems. I like Mathematics.
- I am also exploring fields of Data Science, Digital Signal Processing and Hardware Implementation within Computer Architecture.
-	Fun fact: I love delving into various domains of Computer Science, but I am too lazy to find a balance between them.

My Background:
-------

- Born and raised in **Mandvi**, Gujarat, I spent the first 15 years of my life there with my parents, younger sister, grandmother, and late grandfather. I am a **Jain** by religion, **Gujju** by blood, and **Indian** by heart.
-  With good results in 10th grade, like any typical brown family kid, I was encouraged to pursue “**ENGINEERING**”. At 16, after completing 10th grade, I moved to **Adipur**, Gujarat for my Intermediate Educaton while preparing for the JEE Mains exam.
- The COVID-19 pandemic led to early completion of GSEB 12th board exams and a delay in JEE Mains and Advanced. I made the most of this time by heading to the most “famous” place for IIT-JEE preparation—**KOTA**. This was a 4-month crash course at “**ATP-Star**”. Luckily, it was the right decision, and I got selected for IIT.
- I’ve always been blessed with luck and unwavering support. Many people have invested in my journey, particularly my **Parents**. I will consider myself successful if I can return even 10% of what they have invested in me.
